MakerFactory Minecraft Java Adventskalender 2018 - my code

https://www.amazon.de/MAKERFACTORY-Adventskalender-Programmieren-Minecraft-Windows-Java/dp/B07J6RVBJL

The original code can be obtained on http://bit.ly/mf-adventskalender-18-pc and is therefore not really closed source. So I included the original code here as well.

This is a maker project for using Minecraft 1.12.x and the AMI Arduino Minecraft Interface Windows application to control an Arduino Nano derivate through Minecraft.
